# Hangman game

Quiz with sample questions about C++.

## Instructions

My target was to show you very simple and clear base for an object oriented project.

You can find main program in main.cpp.
The question class overview in a question.h file.
and the exact code of this class in a question.cpp file.
The main function read all questions from the quiz.txt textfile.

You can add so many questions as you want and just update the questions number in a loop in main function.

It's very simple example of a construction of object oriented project. 
This project was build from separate blocks - instead of writing code in a one file.
